# Additional coding resources

## Multithreading with `data.table`

Enable Multithread with data.table in Mac/Intel chips offers faster and more efficient data processing, allowing for quicker analysis of complex datasets. 

[Go to the tutorial](multithread/multithread.pdf)


## Code snippets

The team generated handy code snippets in R to generate script headers, ggplot templates, among others. These snippets can be found in the [`code_snippets.txt`](https://github.com/SimCRC/.github/blob/main/code_snippets.txt) file. It is important to note that these snippets can be updated and extended in future versions of the code.

### What are snippets?

Snippets are pieces of re-usable boilerplate code. They are very useful to avoid the repetition of writing several lines of code since they are a way to automate the insertion of pre-made pieces of code.

### How to use snippets?

To insert a snippet you have to write it, press `Tab`, and then select it from a completion list.

![Snippet autocompletion list.](figs/snippet_1.png){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

It will be inserted along with some text placeholders which you can fill in. To move to the next placeholder you have to press `Tab`.

### How to add new snippets?

To create or customize snippets, in RStudio you have to access `Global Options/Code/Editing` and click into *Edit Snippets*. In that window you will see the list of all the snippets present in your computer.

To add the list of [predefined snippets](https://github.com/SimCRC/.github/blob/main/code_snippets.txt) you just have to copy them and paste them by adding new lines in *Edit Snippets.*

To create your own custom snippets, or to edit the existing ones please read the [RStudio Snippets](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio_snippets.html) website. This [website](https://www.hertiecodingclub.com/events/07_shorcuts_r/) can also be of help if you are looking for additional shortcuts or capabilities included in RStudio.
